##
# This program takes input from the user requesting the question number and outputs the question. The user can then
# attempt to answer the question. An output is then sent to show if the input was right or wrong. If wrong, the user
# can try to answer again. They are also able to ask for a hint that gradually shows the correct answer until fully 
# revealed. If right, the user input another question number or ends the program.
#
# All questions taken from the New City Catechism.
